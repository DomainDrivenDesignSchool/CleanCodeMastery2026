Clean Code Mastery Resources
============================

This page collects **high-signal learning resources** used or referenced during the **Clean Code Mastery Workshop**.The focus is on **thinking, design, and decision-making**- not tools or trends.

> Prefer fewer, deeper resources over endless links.

Videos & Talks
-----------------

*   **GoTo Book Club – Guides to Better Programming** A conversation between **Allen Holub** and **Robert C. Martin** (Uncle Bob).They discuss what actually helps developers grow: principles, habits, books, and long-term thinking- beyond hype and frameworks.▶️ [https://gotopia.tech/episodes/88/guides-to-better-programming](https://gotopia.tech/episodes/88/guides-to-better-programming)
    
* **Robert C. Martin – Clean Code (Selected Talks)** A collection of Uncle Bob’s talks on clean code, professionalism, and software craftsmanship.Focuses on _why_ clean code matters, not just _how_.▶️ [https://cleancoders.com](https://cleancoders.com)
    

Books (Core Reading)
-----------------------

These books form the **intellectual backbone** of the workshop:

*   **Clean Code**Naming, functions, classes, and the ethics of readability.
    
*   **Refactoring**The definitive guide to improving code safely and incrementally.
    
*   **A Philosophy of Software Design**Deep insights into complexity, abstraction, and why “easy changes” matter.
    

Articles & Essays
--------------------

*   **Kent Beck – Small Steps**Why incremental change beats big rewrites- a core refactoring mindset.[https://tidyfirst.substack.com](https://tidyfirst.substack.com)
    
*   **Eric Evans – What I’ve Learned About DDD**Clarifies common misunderstandings about modeling, purity, and real-world constraints.[https://www.domainlanguage.com](https://www.domainlanguage.com)
    

Mental Models & Practices
----------------------------

These are referenced repeatedly during exercises and reviews:

*   **Code Smells as Signals**Smells are _information_, not commands. They require judgment.
    
*   **Biological Metaphor**From atom → organism, refactoring must respect the level of abstraction.
    
*   **Design by Contract (DbC)**Make assumptions explicit to enable safe refactoring and clearer APIs.
    

Practice-Focused Resources
-----------------------------

*   **Refactoring Catalog** – Martin FowlerA practical index of refactoring techniques with intent and trade-offs.[https://refactoring.com/catalog/](https://refactoring.com/catalog/)
    
*   **Go Proverbs**Idiomatic guidance for Go teams- especially relevant for our DbC discussions.[https://go-proverbs.github.io/](https://go-proverbs.github.io/)
    

How to Use These Resources
-----------------------------

*   **Before sessions:** skim to align mental models
    
*   **During reviews:** reference concepts explicitly (“this smells like…”)
    
*   **After sessions:** go deeper- especially books and long-form talks
